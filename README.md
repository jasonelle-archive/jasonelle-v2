## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)


### What about the Original Jasonette?

*Jasonette* is the framework on wich *Jasonelle* is based on. You can know more about
why we created this fork in the following [issue](https://github.com/Jasonette/Jasonette/issues/23).

### What about Jason App?

You now have to compile it in order to run. Maybe we can upload a new version
in the future.

### What about Jason Base?

It would not be available if the servers or the domain shut downs. 
We recommend moving your jsons to a server you own.

We are working on an implementation you can use to store your jsons.
